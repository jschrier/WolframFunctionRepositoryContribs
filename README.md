## Cheminformatics

* [MoleculeNeutralize](https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/resources/MoleculeNeutralize): Neutralize the ionic form of a molecule provided as a Molecule, SMILES, or InChI string 
* [MACCSKeys](https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/resources/MACCSKeys): Compute the 166-bit MACCS (Molecular ACCess System) key. Includes some cute visualization options
* [MolecularGraphAutocorrelation](https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/resources/MolecularGraphAutocorrelation): Compute molecular graph autocorrelation vectors, convolved over atomic properties.

## General

* [MapBatched](https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/resources/MapBatched): Maps a function to a list or association, inserting an operation between batches (facilitates inserting a Pause between queries to a series of RESTful API calls)
